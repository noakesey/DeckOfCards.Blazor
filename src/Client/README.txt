Design an application which allows the user to 

	View (show details of the cards as they were dealt and shuffled)
	Shuffle (only when there are 52 cards in it.)
	Deal (Once dealt, it must be discarded from the deck.)
	Start over (At any time - revert the deck back to how it was at the start with 52 ordered cards.)

The application should start with a full, ordered deck which comprises of one of each value of each suit.

	Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades
	Numbers 2 - 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace

The application UI can be any format you wish, e.g.:

	WinForms
	Web - MVC/Angular/React

You should think about reuse, readability and exception handling.
