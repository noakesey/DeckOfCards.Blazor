### Technical test - Deck of Cards

Design an application which allows the user to view, shuffle and deal cards from a deck. The
application should start with a full, ordered deck which comprises of one of each value of each suit.

The suits are:

- Hearts
- Diamonds
- Clubs
- Spades

The values are:

- Numbers 2 - 10
- Jack
- Queen
- King
- Ace

A user should be able to shuffle the deck when there are 52 cards in it.

Once a card has been dealt, it must be discarded from the deck.

A user should be able "start over" at any time. This means getting the deck back to how it was
at the start with 52 ordered cards.

The application should be able to show details of the cards as they were dealt and shuffled.

The application UI can be any format you wish, e.g.:

- WinForms
- Web - MVC/Angular/React

You should think about reuse, readability and exception handling.
